These programs are adapted from the examples in 
https://www.mathworks.com/help/lidar/ug/aerial-lidar-segmentation-using-pointnet-network.html. 
The adaptation is mainly to use pointNet++ to train my own data.
Other functions in the program can be found directly from the matlab example. 
I only uploaded the main program and function that I modified here.
